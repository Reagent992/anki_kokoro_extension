# dev description

## TODO

- [x] Update the existing note in the collection at the Background. This allows us to close the editor before TTS finishes its work.
- [x] Fixed `TimeoutError`: the default startup time has increased from 1 to 10 seconds.
- [x] Add a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+SHIFT+T)
- [ ] Anything inserted while TTS is loading is overwritten (deleted).
